# Final Review

## Wednesday

Final 2014 is representative of what you'll expect on the final. Some different
topics.

Short answer needs brief justification.
Need more than just a definition.

Countable sets (picture + few words)


Definitions:
Savitch's theorem
NPSPACE
PSPACE

If you can do something non-deterministically, you can kill the N and do it
deterministically.

PSPACE-complete

By definition: A is PSPACE-complete means that A is in PSPACE, and any language
in PSPACE can be reduced to in polynomial time to A.

$P^A$ means a polynomial time Turing machine with an oracle $A$.

No horrifically long TMs. Something with a fairly simple algorithm.

Likely won't need multitape (gucci tho).


## Friday

### Pumping Lemma

let $s = a^100 \in L$, then $s = xyz$

### Myhill-Nerode

Compute accepting futures from $a^{0-100}$

### Walk counting functions

number of words length n satisfying

$f(n) = c_1 f(n-1)+\ldots + c_{100} f(n-100)$.



### NP reductions + NTM

Universal Turing machine

HALT is recognizable, not decidable.

Most theorems about Turing machines with oracle L, don't depend on L.

Cook-Levin theorem
